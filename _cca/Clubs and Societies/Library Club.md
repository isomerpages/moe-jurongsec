## Library Club 

![](/images/LibraryClub_formal_2023.jpg)

The JSS Library Club seeks to cultivate student librarians as critical readers in order to encourage other students to enjoy reading. Our student librarians aim to foster and maintain a passion and enthusiasm for a wide variety of literary genres through designing and coordinating book-related activities. Additionally, our student librarians help the school librarian run and maintain the library as a hub for learning and discussion.
