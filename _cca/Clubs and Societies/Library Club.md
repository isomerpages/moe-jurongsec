<h2>Library Club</h2><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/LibraryClub_formal_2023.jpg"></div><p>The JSS Library Club seeks to cultivate student librarians as critical readers in order to encourage other students to enjoy reading. Our student librarians aim to foster and maintain a passion and enthusiasm for a wide variety of literary genres through designing and coordinating book-related activities. Additionally, our student librarians help the school librarian run and maintain the library as a hub for learning and discussion.</p>
