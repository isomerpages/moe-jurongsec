## Library Club 

![](/images/JSSLC1.jpg)

The JSS Library Club seeks to cultivate student librarians as critical readers in order to encourage other students to enjoy reading. In order to foster and maintain a passion and enthusiasm for a wide variety of literary genres, our student librarians design and coordinate book-related activities. Additionally, our student librarians help the school librarian run and maintain the library as a hub for learning and discussion.
