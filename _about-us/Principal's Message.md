Welcome to Jurong Secondary School!

Jurong Secondary School was the first secondary school established in Taman Jurong constituency in 1963. Since then, Jurong Secondary students have been actively contributing to the residents in the community through various outreach efforts. Through community service, our students learn important values and develop strength of character. When they are able to identify needs of others, they are developing empathy for others. When they can interact with all members of society, helping the young and old, for an inclusive Singapore, they are developing compassion, selflessness and generosity.

Jurong Secondary has an impressive record of excellence in both the academic and non-academic domains. The opportunities given to our students extend to inter-disciplinary fields such as environmental education as our Applied Learning Programme and “Sporty at Heart, Sporting in Mind” for our Learning for Life Programme.

Most of all, I am proud of the dedicated corps of teachers in Jurong Secondary, who are committed to their calling. They want only the best for our students, and tirelessly put in time and effort to ensure that our students learn and grow well.

Last year was yet another challenging year for Singapore and our schools. Nonetheless, we are hopeful that 2022 brings new possibilities and opportunities. We look forward to yet another meaningful year of learning for Jurong Secondary students. Our commitment to our Vision and Mission, as well as our timeless school values of Loyalty, Industry, Sincerity & Love, will ensure we provide a holistic educational experience. Through the core and co-curriculum, leveraging technology in our teaching and learning, we will ensure that our students are well-prepared for their future. Onward towards developing Champions of Mind, and Leaders with Heart.

Here’s wishing all a good year ahead,<br>
Mrs Lim Su-Chin
