### Introduction to the JSS Alumni Association

As a fraternity, the JSS Alumni Association aims to forge school ties and community involvement between Jurong Secondary School and her former students. The Alumni offers and provides expertise and resources for the development and benefit of our students by encouraging their spirit of volunteerism. In doing so, they forge school ties and community involvement among our current and former students. 
  
The JSS Alumni Association also organises events to build camaraderie amongst alumni of JSS. Key events include the yearly golf tournament, the Chinese New Year Dinner, and alumni basketball tournament. Other ad hoc events include bowling competitions and movie screenings. 

In recent years, the JSS Alumni Association has graciously sponsored the Alumni Book Prizes to students who have performed well academically, and the Alumni Sports Excellence Award to student athletes who have excelled in sporting events at the National level. In addition, the JSS Alumni Association also supported the school in major school projects such as the DSA Science Communication and Research (SCoRe) and JSS 55th Anniversary Carnival. These continued contributions demonstrate the JSS Alumni Association’s high level of commitment to the holistic development of JSS students.
