<h3><strong>2026 – A Year of Purposeful Growth</strong></h3>
<p>As we embark on 2026, I am reminded of the words of Maya Angelou: "We
delight in the beauty of the butterfly, but rarely admit the changes it
has gone through to achieve that beauty." This profound observation captures
the essence of what I envision will be "A Year of Purposeful Growth" at
Jurong Secondary School—a year where we embrace not just the outcomes of
our development, but the intentional journey of transformation itself.</p>
<p>Our school is committed to nurture champions of mind and leaders with
heart. Guided by our mission to journey together, strive for excellence
and shape values, we are committed to creating an environment where every
member of our school community can flourish. Our core values of loyalty,
industry, sincerity and love continue to anchor our daily interactions
and shape the caring and learning school culture we build together.</p>
<p>This year, I want to emphasise the importance of intentionality in our
approach to growth. True development does not happen by chance. It requires
deliberate effort, thoughtful reflection, and a commitment to continuous
improvement and developing daily habits. Whether you are a student discovering
your passions and potential, a parent supporting your child's journey,
or a staff member dedicated to educational excellence, I encourage you
to embrace the responsibility that comes with purposeful growth.</p>
<p>The onus lies with each of us to not only focus on our personal development
but also to actively contribute to the growth of those around us. When
we help our peers overcome challenges, celebrate their achievements, and
learn from one another's experiences, we create a community where everyone
thrives. This collective approach to growth embodies the very essence of
what it means to be a caring leader.</p>
<p>Our student outcomes reflect this philosophy. We strive to develop young
people who are not only academically capable but also emotionally intelligent,
socially responsible, and equipped with the skills and mindset needed for
lifelong learning. Through our comprehensive programmes and supportive
environment, we aim to nurture students who will graduate as confident
individuals ready to make positive contributions to their communities and
beyond.</p>
<p>As we journey through 2026 together, let us remember that growth is a
daily commitment. Each interaction, each lesson learned, and each act of
kindness contributes to our collective progress. I am confident that with
intentionality, mutual support, and unwavering dedication to our shared
values, this will indeed be a transformative year for our entire school
community.</p>
<p>Together, we grow stronger.</p>
<p>Yours in partnership</p>
