<h3><strong>2025 – A Year of Purposeful Growth</strong></h3>
<p>At Jurong Secondary School, we believe that every child is a success story
waiting to unfold. As we walk along our vibrant corridors each morning,
our teachers are filled with pride and excitement for the unique potential
each day brings to our students.</p>
<p>We seek to nurture students into well-rounded individuals ready to face
tomorrow's challenges. We are committed to hone the four desired outcomes
of a JSS student - Adaptive Thinker, Concerned Citizen, Confident Person
and Persevering Learner. These are not just words on a wall – they are
the foundation of every lesson, every interaction, and every achievement
we celebrate together.</p>
<p>'<strong>J</strong>ourneying together, <strong>S</strong>haping values, <strong>S</strong>triving
towards excellence' is not just our mission statement – it is our daily
reality. Our teachers and parents have witnessed countless success stories,
both big and small, as our students grow. From a shy child finding his
or her voice in a school play to a budding animator achieving an award
at a national competition, or an athlete pushing his or her limits to set
a new personal best, these moments remind me that every child has the potential
for growth and greatness.</p>
<p>We are particularly proud of our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) titled
"Design for Smart and Sustainable Urban Living". Through this programme,
we commit to nurturing tomorrow's creators of smart solutions, empowering
all students through a hands-on, minds-on learning approach. It is inspiring
to see our students engage with content beyond the national curriculum,
with a strong emphasis on the use of technology, STEM-related skills, sustainability,
and living.</p>
<p>Equally important is our strong focus on sports. We believe that sports
are a powerful driver for achieving our desired outcomes. Through sports,
our students learn invaluable lessons about teamwork, discipline, resilience,
and leadership. These experiences contribute significantly to making every
child's journey a success story.</p>
<p>We are blessed to have a strong support network. Our dedicated staff,
supportive parents, active School Advisory Committee (SAC), engaged alumni,
industry partners, and the warm Taman Jurong community all play crucial
roles in creating a rich, nurturing environment where every child can thrive.</p>
<p>At the heart of our school are the values we hold dear: Loyalty, Industry,
Sincerity and Love. I have seen these values in action – in students supporting
each other through tough times, in the tireless efforts of our teachers,
and in the genuine care that permeates our school culture.</p>
<p>We believe in holistic education, supporting our students not just in
academics, but in their Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), sports, and personal
interests too. It brings me joy to see each child find their own path to
success, whether it is excelling in mathematics, showcasing athletic prowess,
or applying STEM skills to a sustainability project.</p>
<p>Looking forward to meeting you and your child on this exciting journey
of growth and discovery, where every child writes their own success story.</p>
<p>Yours in Partnership</p>
