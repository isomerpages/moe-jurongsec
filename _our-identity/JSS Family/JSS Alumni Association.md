### Introduction to the JSS Alumni Association
------------------------------------------
The JSS Alumni Association (JSSAA) is an integral part of the JSS family. As a valued partner of our school, the Alumni Association is dedicated to serving our alumni and supporting our school's programs and development. 

The JSS Alumni Association also organises events to build camaraderie amongst alumni of JSS. Key events include the yearly golf tournament, the Chinese New Year Dinner, and alumni basketball tournament. Other ad hoc events include bowling competitions and movie screenings.

In recent years, the JSS Alumni Association has graciously sponsored the Alumni Book Prizes to students who have performed well academically, and the Alumni Sports Excellence Award to student athletes who have excelled in sporting events at the National level. 

In addition, the JSS Alumni Association also supported the school in major school programme and facilities such as the sponsorship of the school gym, Food Donation Drive for Needy Families in Taman Jurong, Sec 4 Career Seminar, DSA Science Communication and Research (SCoRe), JSS 60th School Anniversary (Past vs Present Games) and 60th School Anniversary (Dinner). These continued contributions demonstrate the JSS Alumni Associationâ€™s high level of commitment to the holistic development of JSS students.
