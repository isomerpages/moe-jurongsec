2023 was a momentous year for Jurong Secondary School as we celebrated our 60th Anniversary as a school built by the community, for the community. It was a time of reflection for all of us here at JSS as we affirmed our commitment our students and the school values that continue to ground us as we write new chapters in the JSS story.

Moving ahead to 2024, the school continues to strive towards making “Every Child a Success Story”. This is a promise to journey with every student who comes through our gates to guide them in their exploration of their interests, their deepening of their passions and their pursuit of excellence. More importantly, we recognise that the success story is a changing entity that shifts and transforms as our own society grows.

Minister of Education Mr Chan Chun Sing shared during Work Plan Seminar 2023 about the growing challenges that our students will face in the future amidst a fractious geopolitical, economic, and social global atmosphere. His assertion that success will come as a result of ensuring that every student is a Creator, a Connector and a Contributor is one that we at JSS are passionate about.

**Creators**

JSS students will be challenged to create novel solutions for our changing world. For example, in our Lower Secondary Applied Learning Programme, students will design and create their own visions of smart liveable and lovable spaces. By applying their understanding of urban sustainability and Micro:bit in our Imaginarium, our makerspace equipped with 3D printers, laser cutters and other design tools, students bring concepts into practicality. In addition, richer Education and Career Guidance experiences will bring this burgeoning creativity into reality.

**Connectors**

To expand the horizons of our students and connect them with the world outside of Singapore, our students will take to the skies on overseas experiences as part of various programmes including our Skills, Talent and Research Development Programme, where they will learn how to bridge divides and connect with the global community. Our school, too, will continue hosting our international partners such as the Koishikawa Secondary School in our efforts to seek new experiences for our students.

**Contributors**

Our students will keep championing the needs of the community as they seek to better the lives of those around them. Through Project COMpassion, students are given the agency to help and contribute to worthy causes they are passionate about. Beyond Project COMpassion, our CCAs also strive to design programmes in their myriad capacities to enrich the lives of the community.

It is this student-centric approach to programme design that we hope to enhance our students’ school experiences and truly help them become Champions of Mind and Leaders with Heart. We continue to work in close partnership with our stakeholders, our parents, School Advisory Committee, alumni and the Taman Jurong Community to help all our students find their success stories, whatever shape those stories may take.

Yours in Partnership,

Ms Yeo Siok Ee
