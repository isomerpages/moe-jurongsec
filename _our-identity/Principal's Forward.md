They have built a strong foundation for the school and enabled the school and its community to continue to grow and flourish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 24px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Inter, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; text-align: justify;" class="">As the newly appointed Principal of Jurong Secondary School (JSS), I am excited to be a part of the JSS Family. JSS has a storied history of commitment to developing and nurturing its students into individuals who champion the school values of Loyalty, Industry, Sincerity and Love. We place student centricity and agency at the heart of our drive to innovate and push the boundaries of what an education in secondary school can offer students. And this, together with the deep relationship our school has with our community, has enabled us to build a strong foundation true to its identity as a school built by the community, for the community. These are the attributes that resonate with me. Together with the JSS Family, we will continue to bring JSS forward in making “Every Child a Success Story”.</p></div><p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 24px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Inter, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; background-color: initial; text-align: left;">This year brings many opportunities for the school and its students. The resumption of more school activities as well as the upcoming National School Games and Singapore Youth Festival will offer our students many opportunities to grow and shine, guided by their teachers, to greater heights. Moreover, 2023 marks JSS’s 60</span><sup style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; background-color: initial; text-align: left;" class="">th</sup><span style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; background-color: initial; text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;</span>Anniversary and with it, celebrations that serve as a way not only to acknowledge and appreciate how far we as a school have come, but also an avenue for our students to develop further as Champions of Mind and Leaders with Heart.</span>&nbsp;</p></div></td><td style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px 15px 15px 0px; vertical-align: top;" width="408px"><br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"><img style="margin: auto; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; max-width: 100%; clear: both; display: block; width: 410px; height: 634px;" class="ive_eobj_center" alt="DSC02347-021.jpeg" width="100%" src="https://jurongsec.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u184/2023%20Documents/DSC02347-021.jpeg"><br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"></td></tr></tbody></table>

Even as we look back on our rich heritage and past, my wish for JSS is for our students to also look towards the future. I hope we can further the school’s own efforts in nurturing our students into Concerned Citizens, Confident Persons, Flexible Thinkers and Persevering Learners by leveraging the unique strengths of our students, staff, parents and alumni through meaningful engagement. This wealth of experience and expertise can support our students’ needs, enable their growth and empower them to author their own future success stories.

I look forward to working in close partnership with our stakeholders to continue to develop our school, staff and students in achieving this vision.

Yours in Partnership
