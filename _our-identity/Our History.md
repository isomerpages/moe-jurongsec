Jurong Secondary School continued to be a trail blazer in both academics and sports.  In 1988, the first edition of the newsletter, Jurong Vision, was published.  The School Choir and English ELDDS staged a musical, Fiddler on the Roof, at the Victoria Theatre in 1989 while the Chinese Orchestra and Chinese Dance Troupe jointly staged a Chinese Music and Dance Night at the Kallang Theatre in 1990.  Pre-University classes were also phased out from Jurong Secondary School in 1991.

Over the years, our school underwent several upgrades and expansions. In 1994, two new blocks of classrooms and special rooms were added. The administrative block, library, science laboratories and the home economics rooms were fully renovated.

### 2004 - Breaking New Ground

PRIME upgrading was near its completion by the end of 2004. Existing classrooms as well as the school canteen, library and the staff room were made bigger. Science laboratories, an administrative block and a new school hall were built. More facilities such as computer laboratories were added as well. In November 2004, the Special Talents and Achievements Recognition (STAR) programme was officially launched. The STAR Programme is a four-year structured talent development scheme designed by JSS teachers to stretch higher-ability students. In 2006, JSS was awarded niche status for Basketball under MOE Direct School Admission Exercise and admitted its first batch of students in 2007. In 2006, the school was also recognised by MOE for its work in quality teaching and learning. The school was selected by MOE to be one of the six secondary schools to lead in curriculum innovation in recognition of JSS teachers’ efforts in TLLM. In the same year, JSS was one of the 10 secondary schools awarded the Flexible Infrastructure Pilot Project (FlexSi) by MOE. The school was also recognised as a LeadIT@school in the same year, which enabled JSS to acquire IT infrastructures such as a Learning Management System, school-wide internet access and tablets PCs to support student learning. In 2006, as part of its move to the global arena, JSS established links with several sister schools in China, namely Xiyao High School in Guangzhou, Shida Middle School in Beijing and Jing Hua Zhong Xue in Shanghai. Students and teachers went on to participate in various overseas exchange programmes. In recognition of the school’s efforts in teamwork, continuous improvements and innovation within the organisation, JSS was awarded the Thinking Culture Award (Zonal) by MOE in 2006. In 2007, the school was awarded the Thinking Culture Award (National).

### The Next Lap

In May 2007, JSS was selected as one of the 5 pioneer FutureSchools in the FutureSchools@Singapore project. As a future school, JSS has the support of MOE, IDA, industrial partners and local universities to lead in the seamless and pervasive integration of ICT into the curriculum as well as to pursue novel school designs to enhance the quality of teaching and learning. JSS was most honoured to host the Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, for a school visit on 20th July 2007. Shortly after his visit, the Prime Minister gave a strong endorsement to JSS. He complimented that JSS has “shown how it is possible to transform the learning environment in neighbourhood schools, to help our young achieve their fullest potential”. So impressed was the Prime Minister with JSS that he made a special mention of the school in his National Day Rally Speech in August 2007. It was a indeed a proud moment in JSS history to receive such a national accolade.
