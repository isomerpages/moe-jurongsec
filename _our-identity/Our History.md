### 1963 - 1973 <bR> The Foundation Years

1963 – a momentous year that witnessed the birth of Jurong Secondary School. 

“By the Community, For the Community” – Indeed, it was community leaders who had requested for a secondary school to be built while the then Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew was on his first visit to Jurong Constituency. On 28 August 1963, Jurong Integrated Secondary School was officially opened at 12th\-mile Jurong Road, with 5 teachers and about 100 students.

The early years saw students of Jurong Secondary School, renamed in 1971, making their mark in the national sporting arena. Jurong boys and girls emerged as National Champions in the Basketball and Cross Country competitions between 1967 and 1972.

### 1974 - 1983: <br> Our New Home

Ready for a bigger role in the community, Jurong Secondary School was moved to a new site at Yuan Ching Road in 1974. On 2nd November, teachers and pupils made the historic march from the old school building to its new premises. The new building was officiated on 2 July 1976.

With new CCA and Library blocks, the school continued to build on its tradition of academic and sporting excellence. As demand for post-secondary education increased over the years, the school was made a Pre-University Centre in 1981, which it served for about a decade, offering a 3-year Pre-U course to Secondary 4 graduands.

While Jurong Secondary School continued to blaze trails in both academics and sports, our students started developing and showcasing talents in the Arts.

Its first major foray into the Arts scene was in 1985 when it staged the Cultural Night in aid of the Community Chest. The school went on to stage dramas and musical performances at the Victoria and Kallang Theatres from 1989 to 1991. In 1988, the first school newsletter, Jurong Vision, was published.
