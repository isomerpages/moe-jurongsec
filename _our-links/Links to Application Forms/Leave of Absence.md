Singaporeans who are planning to go overseas for work or other reasons may reserve a place for their child in the current school under the Leave of Absence (LOA) Scheme. Upon their return to Singapore, the children can be readmitted directly to the school.

Applicants are to submit the completed [LOA Application Form](https://form.gov.sg/#!/60f8dd72f516090011ebc9af) and the LOA fees to the school.

More information may be obtained on [MOE's website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans).
