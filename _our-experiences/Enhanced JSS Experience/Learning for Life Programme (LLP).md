### Learning for Life programme
The Learning for Life programme provides students with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and strengthen their people skills. 

### Framework
We shape students' values and help them build Loyalty, Industry, Sincerity and Love through our distinctive "Sporty at Heart, Sporting in Mind" programme, which provides experiential learning opportunities that develop character, instil rootedness and responsibility for their community and fellow Singaporeans.

Students are supported in their pursuit of excellence in their studies, CCA and interests by applying our three-tiered framework of 1) Know, 2) Do, 3) Excel, across different levels of participation, from mass participation to participation by the talented or passionate, emphasising value acquisition and transference into how we live and work.

This integrated approach ensures that our LLP serves as an integral aspect and distinctive signature approach of Character and Citizenship Education, where sports participation builds not only physical fitness but also strong character and desired values that align with our school's vision of developing Champions of Mind and Leaders with Heart.

### Student Outcomes 
Through our Learning for Life programme, we develop Adaptive Thinkers who can navigate challenges through sports experiences, Confident Persons who express themselves positively through physical activities, Persevering Learners who embrace the Know-Do-Excel progression, and Concerned Citizens who demonstrate rootedness and responsibility for their community through sporting values and healthy lifestyle choices.

Areas explored in LLP may include, among others, outdoor adventure learning, sports, student leadership development, uniformed groups, performing and visual arts.
