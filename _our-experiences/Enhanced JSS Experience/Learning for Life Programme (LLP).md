<h3>Learning for Life programme</h3>
<p>The Learning for Life programme provides students with real-life experiential
learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes,
self-expression and strengthen their people skills.</p>
<h3>Framework</h3>
<p>We shape students' values and help them build Loyalty, Industry, Sincerity
and Love through our distinctive "Sporty at Heart, Sporting in Mind" programme,
which provides experiential learning opportunities that develop character,
instil rootedness and responsibility for their community and fellow Singaporeans.</p>
<p>Students are supported in their pursuit of excellence in their studies,
CCA and interests by applying our three-tiered framework of 1) Know, 2)
Do, 3) Excel, across different levels of participation, from mass participation
to participation by the talented or passionate, emphasising value acquisition
and transference into how we live and work.</p>
