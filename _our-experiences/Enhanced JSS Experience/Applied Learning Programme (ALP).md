### Environmental Studies: A multi-disciplinary approach to sustainable urban living.

**Why Environmental Studies?** <br>
As a small island state, Singapore must monitor trends in the global landscape, anticipate challenges and plan ahead to ensure its future sustainability. One of our key challenges facing the world today is environmental sustainability.

Environmental Studies focuses on the interdisciplinary connections and interactions between environmental and social systems. It requires our students to think critically about environmental issues and actively participate in experiences where they can apply their knowledge.  This includes serving our community with the knowledge and skills for environmental change.

**What is Environmental Studies experience like?** <br>
The Environmental Studies ALP is a programme that progressively raises the awareness and hones our students’ knowledge and skills in the area of environmental studies while leveraging related and relevant knowledge and skills in the Lower Secondary Science and Geography syllabuses. All lower secondary students will go through bi-weekly lessons designed by the school’s dedicated ALP committee with the aim of providing a learning experience that is authentic and activity-based.

Students who are passionate about environmental studies can opt to pursue specialised mini projects delving deeper into challenges and ways to manage real-world environmental issues, tapping on knowledge provided by mentors versed in the areas of Engineering, Life Sciences, Urban Design and Environment or Geo-spatial technologies.
