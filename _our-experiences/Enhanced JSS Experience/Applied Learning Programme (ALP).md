<h3>Design for Smart and Sustainable Urban Living</h3>
<p>Through our ALP (Applied Learning Programme) titled <em>Design for Smart and Sustainable Urban Living</em>,
we commit to <strong><em>Nurturing Tomorrowâ€™s Creators of Smart Solutions</em></strong>,
and empower all students through a <strong><em>hands-on, minds-on learning approach</em></strong>.
This features a range of learning experiences that cover content outside
of the national curriculum, with an emphasis on

<h5><strong><u>Tier 1 Curriculum</u></strong></h5>
<p>All Secondary 1 and 2 students will engage in a curriculum featuring hands-on
activities that allow them to acquire coding skills and design thinking
concepts. This enables them to apply these skills through problem-solving
inquiry projects, demonstrate their learning by developing and building
prototypes, and apply their knowledge to everyday life applications.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 1</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Trash to Treasure: Green-Minded Play</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Series of Micro:bit-infused lessons with hands-on activities for students
to learn by tinkering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inquiry projects related to sustainable urban living, urban stresses,
and liveability concepts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Secondary 2</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Smart Loveable Spaces</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Gain understanding of issues related to the ramifications of urbanization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify and develop feasible technology-driven solutions to enhance community
liveability for greater resilience and sustainability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lessons and projects utilise the design thinking framework, providing
students with an accessible protocol to explore the community around them
and tinker with prototypes to create workable solutions. Students will
have the opportunity to showcase their best work at our annual Green Carnival
and Maker Faire.</p>
<p><strong><u>Tier 2 Learning Experiences</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Tier 2 offerings allow interested and passionate students to delve deeper
into how technology can be used to solve problems related to urban living.</p>
<p><strong>School-Run Workshops</strong>
</p>
<p>These workshops provide students with greater exposure and training in
design thinking and STEM-related fields. Examples include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

* STEAM Week Workshops focusing on emerging STEM tools (e.g. Chibitronics).
* Climate and sustainability talks conducted by the Earth Observatory of Singapore.
* Exploring sustainable food options (e.g. edible insects)

</ul>
<p><strong>Local &amp; Overseas Learning Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p>JSS students can embark on enriching learning journeys to industry bodies,
partners, and companies. These experiences allow students to gain practical
insights, broaden their worldview, and deepen their knowledge. Examples
include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Visit to BuildTech Asia 2024 &amp; 2025, featuring innovations in built sustainability
and green living ideas for smart living and environmental sustainability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overseas immersion trip to Tokyo, Japan (in 2024) and Shanghai (in 2025) for hands-on STEM and
applied learning experiences in a culturally rich environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Competitions</strong>
</p>
<p>JSS students participate in competitions to broaden their learning experiences
and enhance their design thinking beyond the school level. These competitions
offer rich and authentic learning opportunities as students gain hands-on
experience. Examples include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Climate Crisis Challenge</strong>: Tackling problems related to
themes such as food insecurity, heat stress, or biodiversity loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NUS National Geo Challenge</strong>: Focusing on sustainability
and climate change.</p>
* **Singapore Youth STEM Fair**: Ideating and prototyping STEM solutions to solving real world problems
