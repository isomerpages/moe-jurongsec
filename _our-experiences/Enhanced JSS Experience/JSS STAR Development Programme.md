### The Programme’s Philosophy:
Guided by our school’s vision of grooming our students to be Champions of Mind and Leaders with Heart, the JSS Skills, Talent and Research (STAR) Development Programme is committed to provide our students the opportunity to stretch their intellectual capacity and talents in areas beyond the core curriculum and to hone their leadership skills.

The STAR Development Programme is a unique three-year programme that has been established since Nov 2004 and is exclusive to Jurong Secondary School (JSS) because it is fully sponsored by members of the School Advisory Committee. They are inspiring examples of how one gives back to the community and how one can create meaning and deliver values to others.&nbsp;

The school has refined the programme to grant our students the freedom to experiment, explore, wonder and question critically. This freedom of inquiry is guided by the discipline of study, the process of design thinking and the ethics of research.&nbsp;

We firmly believe that when one is blessed with talents, they should in turn be a blessing to others.


### The Outcomes of the JSS STAR Student
The programme strives to nurture students who shall be exemplary in the following aspects:

_**As Champions of Mind**_,&nbsp;students of Intellectual Strength who:
* possess the disposition to think flexibly in dealing with the ambiguities of our world;
* demonstrate the ability to question critically for effective problem solving;
* communicate with confidence, clarity and precision in qualifying their viewpoints;
* evaluate the productiveness of their own thinking and strategies.

and are students of Resilience who:

### The Curriculum:



### The Value of Design Thinking &amp; Research:

Developing a design thinking mindset and research awareness amongst students is significant to their growth and maturity as it:
* facilitates learning beyond the classroom, provides a meaningful platform to apply and synthesise knowledge gained;
* encourages empathy in understanding the needs of others when developing ideas and solutions;
* broadens perspectives of students with guidance by teacher mentors;
* raises confidence to communicate projects clearly and effectively;
* cultivates good team dynamics to equip students with the right attitudes and social skills for the future.

### Talent Development Experiences:
Each JSS STAR Student will be able to participate in selected workshops, learning journeys, conferences and seminars that are fully subsidised by the school in order to further their development.&nbsp;

In addition, the school will provide full subsidy for student's participation in approved academic competitions and training fees incurred for the year. As part of the terms, the Overseas Immersion Programme in Year 3 will be heavily subsidised by the school with co-payment by the student via their Edusave accounts.  

Continued enrolment in the programme is renewed biannually. It is subject to satisfactory performance in the STAR Programme and in the academic results of each student. Should the student’s performance or conduct not be satisfactory, the school reserves the right to withdraw the student from the programme.
