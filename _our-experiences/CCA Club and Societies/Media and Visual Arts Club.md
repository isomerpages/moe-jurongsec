### Media and Visual Arts Club


![](/images/JSMVAC1.jpg)

At MVAC, we provide our students with opportunities to develop their skills in various media fields such as photography, videography, animation, and equipment management. Our modular programs aim to promote media literacy among students, as they participate in exciting workshops and training sessions conducted by experienced professionals currently working in these fields. We encourage our members to participate in regional, national, and international competitions in animation, photography, art, and design to enhance their exposure while also developing useful skills such as problem-solving, resource management, and project management.
