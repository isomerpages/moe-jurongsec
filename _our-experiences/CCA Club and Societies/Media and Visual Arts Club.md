To hone their talents in these fields, students at the MVAC participate in photography, videography, animation, and equipment management. With the many modular programs, media literacy is being promoted. Our members take part in a variety of engaging workshops and training sessions led by qualified experts who are presently employed in these fields. They are encouraged to take part in regional, national, and international animation, photography, and various art and design competitions to increase their exposure while gaining useful abilities like problem-solving, resource management, and project management.
