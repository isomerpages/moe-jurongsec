## Environment Club 


![](/images/JSSEC1.jpg) 


The Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) programme of pledging to the “Kosong Plan,” an ambitious goal to live a net-zero carbon lifestyle, is promoted by the Environment Club. The group uses the Assembly and CCE period to spread the idea that changing our diets and modes of transportation might help us leave a smaller carbon impact. The club encourages students to practise the seven Rs: Rethink, Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle, and Replenish. It also provides guidance to the class’s Environment Representatives as they lead environmental activities like sewing and producing posters with their classrooms. Finally, as part of Taman Jurong’s National Day celebrations, some of the club’s members also lead upcycling workshops for the neighborhood’s residents. These workshops draw a sizable audience, and the club members receive excellent reviews from the attendees.
