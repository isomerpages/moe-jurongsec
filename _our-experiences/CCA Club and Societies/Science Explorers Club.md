### Science Explorers Club


![](/images/JSSE1.jpg)


The Explorer’s Club seeks to promote creativity and all-around life skills like self-assurance, communication, and leadership. The Explorers are given the chance to learn new scientific and research techniques that aren’t typically covered in traditional science curriculum. The club also enhances its members’ knowledge of IOT (Internet of Things) and AI, and it will progressively change its emphasis from science research to robotics. The Explorers participated in a number of robotics competitions as well, including the First Lego League and the National Robotics Challenge each year.
