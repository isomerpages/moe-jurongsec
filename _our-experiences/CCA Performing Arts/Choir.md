## Choir



The Jurong Chorale participated in the first-ever SYF online in 2021, recording its choir members' voices in groups of five before putting the recording together and submitting it. Both the teachers and the kids had a fantastic learning experience. The choir was no longer permitted to perform live singing as a result of Covid. In order to brighten everyone's spirits, teachers and students invited the choir to join in on games and bonding activities. Jurong Chorale participated in SYFgoesOnline! 2021, the West Zone Cluster virtual chorus, the NDP online choir, and the W4 Stand Together virtual choir.
