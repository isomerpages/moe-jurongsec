## Symphonic Band

![](/images/JS1_Jurong%20Symphonic%20Band.jpg)

Jurong Symphonic Band (JSB) continues to provide everyone with lovely music in spite of the Covid-19 crisis. The JSB followed strong safe management procedures as it prepared for the annual SYF. The Secondary Two pupils gave their first performance at that time as well. The members of JSB were able to function as a unit despite the obstacles they met along the way and overcome them. The members also encouraged loyalty, love, and camaraderie among one another.
