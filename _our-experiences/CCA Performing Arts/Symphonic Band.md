## Symphonic Band


The Jurong Symphonic Band aims to develop students with cultural awareness and appreciation through music education. The students are exposed to repertoires of music, gaining insights into the music they play and cultivating their appreciation for different music genres. Our graduating cohort continues with the tradition of planning for their very own concert - Symphonium V, where they showcase their passion for music to their families and friends.

In April 2025, the band went for Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and was awarded the Certificate of Distinction, which is an achievement for all the students.

The band is committed to continue to highlight students' musical talents and creativity through various school programmes and performances, providing them with platforms to celebrate their achievement together as a family.
