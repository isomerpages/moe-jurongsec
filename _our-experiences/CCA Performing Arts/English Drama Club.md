The English Drama Club (EDC) strives to cultivate the acting talents and self-awareness of our students. Each year, our students engage in a rigorous process of designing and scriptwriting as they prepare for the year's biggest drama competition, such as the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation held twice a year. This year, their original production titled "Mirage" garnered the Distinction prize at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (Drama) 2021, showcasing their exceptional creativity and skills.
