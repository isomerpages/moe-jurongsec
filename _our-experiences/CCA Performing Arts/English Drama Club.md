## English Drama Club

The English Drama Club (EDC) seeks to mold our students into talented and self-aware actors. Our students go through a designing and scriptwriting process every year as part of their preparation for the year's biggest drama competition, such as the twice-yearly Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. Their original production, "Mirage," which was created this year, won the Distinction prize for the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (Drama) 2021.
