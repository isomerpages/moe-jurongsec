## Contemporary Dance

![](/images/JS1_Contemporary%20Dance.jpg)

Through various dance styles, i-DANCE.ity focuses on assisting participants in discovering their artistic talent. We foster the development of well-rounded persons in our four-year program because we think that students should be engaged members of their communities. Our dancers participated in SYF 2021 and securely attended training sessions even during Covid-19. The crew of dancers has become more unified as a result of this event.
