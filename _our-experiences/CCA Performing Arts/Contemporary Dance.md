## Contemporary Dance
![Dance 2024](/images/contemporary_dance_2.jpg)

i-DANCE.ity is a dance CCA that aims to cultivate the artistic talents of its participants through various dance styles. Our four-year program not only focuses on developing their dance skills but also on nurturing well-rounded individuals who are active members of their communities. Despite the challenges posed by Covid-19, our dancers were able to participate in SYF 2021 and attend training sessions with proper safety measures in place. The event served as a unifying experience for the dance crew and further strengthened their bond.
