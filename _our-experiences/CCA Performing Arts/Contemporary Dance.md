## Contemporary Dance


Our Modern Dance CCA provides students with an exciting platform to explore contemporary movement and artistic expression. Through dynamic training sessions, dancers develop technical skills, creativity, and confidence whilst learning various modern dance styles and choreographic techniques. Our dedicated members work collaboratively to create compelling performances that showcase their passion and artistry.

The CCA emphasizes both individual growth and teamwork, fostering discipline, perseverance, and mutual support amongst dancers. Students have opportunities to perform at school events and external competitions, building stage presence and performance experience.

We are proud of our dancers' commitment and talent, which was recognized with a Distinction award at the 2025 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. This achievement reflects the hard work, dedication, and artistic excellence that defines our Modern Dance community.

Join us to discover the joy of movement, express your creativity, and be part of a vibrant artistic family that celebrates the beauty of contemporary dance.
