## Red Cross 
![RC 2024](/images/red_cross_youth_2.jpg)

The Red Cross Youth (RCY) program aims to cultivate leadership skills, character development, and promote knowledge of blood donation among our cadets. Our curriculum includes a range of activities, such as serving the underprivileged, fundraising for the community, and participating in international humanitarian projects. These activities prepare our cadets to become responsible citizens with a strong sense of civic duty.
