## Girl Guides



Our Girl Guides engage in activities designed to cultivate their confidence and self-assurance when confronting novel and unpredictable situations and challenges. Through hands-on experiences, they acquire valuable skills that enable them to lead and participate in community service projects that make a positive impact in the community.

The connections forged through these community activities are often enduring and have the potential to last a lifetime. The friendships our students form while making a difference in their community are a testament to the enduring value of service and the bonds it can create.
