The National Cadet Corps (Land) unit plays a critical role in shaping our cadets into confident and capable leaders. NCC HQ unit, along with our school's dedicated Teacher Officers, orchestrate military-style training programs that challenge our cadets to develop their cognitive and leadership abilities, as well as their teamwork skills.

These skill-based training programs provide our cadets with the opportunity to hone their strengths and acquire new competencies. The training builds character and fosters a sense of camaraderie among our cadets. It prepares them to face challenges with resilience, strength of heart and mind, and to lead with purpose and determination.
