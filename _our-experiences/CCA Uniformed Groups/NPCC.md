The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) aims to shape students into responsible, dedicated, civic-minded, resilient, and resourceful members of society. The exceptional curriculum, designed collaboratively by our experienced instructors and teachers, has produced outstanding results, as evidenced by two of our cadet leaders being awarded the prestigious SPF NPCC badge.

Through rigorous training and engaging activities, our cadets develop a strong sense of civic duty and responsibility. They learn to embody the qualities of perseverance, accountability, and resourcefulness that are essential for becoming effective leaders in their communities. The NPCC program instills in our students the values and skills needed to make positive contributions to society and lead with confidence and integrity.
