The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) aims to shape students into responsible, civic-minded, resilient, and resourceful members of society. Through rigorous training and engaging activities, cadets develop a strong sense of civic duty, perseverance, and accountabilityâ€”qualities essential for becoming effective community leaders.

Signature programmes such as Unarmed Tactics, Crime Scene Investigation (CSI), and Revolver 0.22 Live Shoot provide cadets with practical skills in self-defense, forensic science, and marksmanship. These experiences not only build discipline and confidence but also cultivate teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership capabilities.

Guided by our values of Resilience, Integrity, Service, and Excellence (RISE), NPCC equips students to lead with confidence, integrity, and a commitment to keeping Singapore safe, empowering them to make meaningful contributions to society.
