## Scouts 
![Scouts 2024](/images/scouts_2.jpg)

The Jurong Screaming Eagle Scout Group nurtures Scouts into responsible and community-minded individuals through experiential learning guided by the Scout Method. Our Scouts develop core outdoor skills such as pioneering, campcraft, cooking, and orienteering, while also growing in teamwork, leadership, and resilience through troop camps, service initiatives, and national-level events.

Beyond outdoor adventures, Scouts take part in meaningful programmes such as Job Week, where they learn the dignity of work and service, and proficiency schemes like the Crime Prevention Badge, where they not only understand the importance of prevention but also contribute by spreading awareness to the community. Growth is consistently recognised through affirmations such as the Chief Commissioner’s Well-Done Badge, which honours Scouts who exemplify the Scout Promise and Law in their contributions to their troop, school, or community. We are also proud that some of our senior Scouts have achieved the prestigious Chief Scout’s Award, the pinnacle of Scouting in Singapore, standing out as exemplary leaders, mentors, and role models.

At the heart of our troop is a culture of mutual support. Scouts build one another up, look out for each other, and take pride in both their successes and the lessons gained from challenges. The troop provides a safe and encouraging space where Scouts can explore, pursue their interests, and grow into confident, caring learners who are ready to serve others.
