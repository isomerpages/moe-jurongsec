Our National Cadet Corps (Land) unit moulds our cadets into leaders with strong heart and mind through the military-like trainings organized by NCC HQ unit and Teacher Officers of our school. Cadets can look forward to experiencing trainings that are skills based which aim to develop their cognitive and leadership skills as well as their ability to work in teams.
