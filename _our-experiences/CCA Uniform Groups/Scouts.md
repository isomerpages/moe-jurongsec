## Scouts 

![](/images/JS-Scouts.jpg)

The Jurong Screaming Eagle Scout Group aims to nurture our Scouts to become civic-minded individuals via hands-on learning experiences that are in line with the Scout Method. Our Scouts typically engage in core scouting skills like pioneering, campcraft, outdoor cooking and orienteering. As part of the four-year Diamond Jubilee Challenge launched by the Singapore Scout Association, there are opportunities for our Scouts to participate in learning journeys and community engagement activities. 4 of our Scouts attained the Chief Commissioner’s Award in 2022, which is the highest honor for the Scout section.
