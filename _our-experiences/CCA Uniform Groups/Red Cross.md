## Red Cross 

![](/images/JS-Red%20Cross%20Youth.jpg)

Our Red Cross Youth (RCY) program seeks to instill in our cadets a sense of leadership, character development, and knowledge of blood donation. Our curriculum also incorporates activities like serving the underprivileged, fundraising for the community, and taking part in international humanitarian projects. The cadets will be prepared by these to become decent citizens with a keen sense of civic duty.
