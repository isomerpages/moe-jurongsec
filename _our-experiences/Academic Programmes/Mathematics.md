## Our Learning Approach

The JSS Mathematics Department consists of dedicated teachers who are committed to nurturing proficient and confident problem solvers. Every teacher is driven by the belief that all students are capable of being developed into independent problem solvers who possess the capacity of analytical and critical thinking skills. Our students will learn to recognize and apply mathematical concepts into real world situations, translating the academic concepts into real world problem solving tools. In addition, we seek to extend our students’ positive disposition in the discipline through their participation in related competitions and activities.

  

The department’s general approach to teaching & learning is inspired by Polya’s Problem Solving Heuristics. It generally consists of 4 stages: Understanding the problem, Devising a plan, Carrying out their plan & checking and extending their solutions.

<b>Pedagogy</b>

<img src="/images/JS_12%20Math.jpg" style="height: auto;width:400px;">

The department believes that the best way to introduce mathematical concepts starts with using concrete examples that our students can relate with. Using their prior knowledge from the concrete examples, we follow up with visuals and pictorials to assist students’ understanding, developing their understanding of the concepts and leading them to formulate their logic of the abstract ideas.

## Our Special Programmes


**Maths Olympiad Training & SASMO (Singapore & Asian Schools Math Olympiad) Competition**

  

This training is generally meant for students who are in the top 10-12% for Mathematics. In addition to preparing the students for competitions, this course also exposes students to creative ‘Out-of the box’ problem-solving skills. Students participating this training will have the opportunity to push their boundaries by participating in the annual SASMO Competition.

  

**Mathematical Problem Solving Module**

  

In alignment to our mission of developing independent problem solvers, our secondary 1E students will go through an enrichment module where they will be introduced to Polya’s problem solving approaching while exercising their creativity in solving mathematical problems and puzzles.

  

**Mathematical Modelling Module**

  

As part of our quest to link mathematics to real world problems, we have integrated a mathematical modelling enrichment module in our sec 2E curriculum. Our sec 2 students will be tasked a with real-world problem, usually in the form of experiments, to formulate simple mathematical model that will best mirror relationships between variables in the experiment.

  

An example of past problems includes students’ exploring the relationship between the diameter of parachutes and its landing time.
