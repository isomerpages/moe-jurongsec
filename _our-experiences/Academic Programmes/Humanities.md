## Our Learning Approach

The Humanities Department is committed to engage students through the Spirit of Inquiry. Through a thorough examination of contemporary issues and historical trends, our students are well-equipped to understand and make decisions in the real world. Our team of passionate, learned, and caring teachers are always striving to make the Humanities relevant for students of the 21st century. Within the classroom, engaged learning is achieved through lively discussion of current issues that have direct relevance to students’ lives. Beyond the classroom, field inquiry and place-based education continue to be a key approach to drive authentic learning and relatedness to the Humanities.

Students undergoing the JSS Humanities learning experience will:

* Understand content and concepts in a relatable and an accessible manner
* Be encouraged to be curious, courageous and confident in approaching societal issues and presenting points of view in a convincing manner
* Participate in performance tasks that enable them with opportunities for learning the discipline in an authentic setting within the community


**Highlights of inquiry-based learning in Humanities**&nbsp;

**Learning Beyond the Classroom**

Our students extended their learning beyond textbooks through hands-on investigations across subjects. In the Geographical Investigation (GI), they gathered data at sites such as Jurong Lake Gardens, Chinatown, and Taman Jurong Park to apply fieldwork skills in real-world settings. The Historical Investigation (HI) allowed them to analyse sources and perspectives to draw evidence-based conclusions, while the Social Studies Issues Investigation (SSI) engaged them in exploring current issues and diverse viewpoints. These experiences deepened their knowledge and nurtured critical thinking, inquiry skills, and active citizenship.

**Competitions and Enrichment Opportunities**

Enrichment activities and competitions provide students with meaningful opportunities to extend their learning and stretch their potential. Our Geography students participate in the annual MOE–NUS Geography Challenge, exploring issues like sustainability and climate change. POA students take part in the National Financial Literacy Challenge, applying accounting knowledge to real-world contexts, while History students join the History Challenge to sharpen their inquiry and analytical skills. Such experiences inspire students to grow beyond the classroom and nurture a spirit of excellence.
