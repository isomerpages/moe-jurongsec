## Our Learning Approach


The Humanities Department is committed to engage students through the Spirit of Inquiry. Through a thorough examination of contemporary issues and historical trends, our students are well-equipped to understand and make decisions in the real world. Our team of passionate, learned and caring teachers are always striving to make the Humanities relevant for students of the 21st century. Within the classroom, engaged learning is achieved through lively discussion of current issues that have direct relevance to studentsâ€™ lives. Beyond the classroom, field inquiry and place-based education continue to be a key approach to drive authentic learning and relatedness to the Humanities.

  

Students undergoing the JSS Humanities learning experience will:

*   Understand content and concepts in a relatable and an accessible manner
*   Be encouraged to be curious, courageous and confident in approaching societal issues and presenting points of view in a convincing manner
*   Participate in performance tasks that enable them with opportunities for learning the discipline in an authentic setting within the community
