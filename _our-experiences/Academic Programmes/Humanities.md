## Our Learning Approach

The Humanities Department is committed to engage students through the Spirit of Inquiry. Through a thorough examination of contemporary issues and historical trends, our students are well-equipped to understand and make decisions in the real world. Our team of passionate, learned, and caring teachers are always striving to make the Humanities relevant for students of the 21st century. Within the classroom, engaged learning is achieved through lively discussion of current issues that have direct relevance to studentsâ€™ lives. Beyond the classroom, field inquiry and place-based education continue to be a key approach to drive authentic learning and relatedness to the Humanities.

Students undergoing the JSS Humanities learning experience will:

*   Understand content and concepts in a relatable and an accessible manner
*   Be encouraged to be curious, courageous and confident in approaching societal issues and presenting points of view in a convincing manner
*   Participate in performance tasks that enable them with opportunities for learning the discipline in an authentic setting within the community

**Highlights of inquiry-based learning in Humanities**&nbsp;

- **Geographical Investigation (GI)**

The GI fieldwork experience provided students with the opportunity to go beyond the classroom and engage in hands-on, outdoor learning by actively gathering data at various investigation field sites such as Jurong Lake Gardens, Ponggol Northshore Estate, Chinatown, and Taman Jurong Park. This approach allowed students to apply their fieldwork skills in real-world settings and address questions that are meaningful to them. The diverse field sites offer students exposure to a variety of environments, fostering a deeper understanding of the world around them and enhancing their analytical and problem-solving abilities.

- **Competitions and Enrichment**

Participation in enrichment activities and competitions offers students a rewarding avenue to experience the joy of learning while pushing their boundaries. These opportunities challenge students to stretch their abilities, encouraging them to maximize their learning potential.

- **MOE-NUS Geography Challenge**

Geography students have the chance to compete in the annual NUS Geography Challenge. This competition allows participants to explore topics such as sustainability and climate change through a geographical lens.
