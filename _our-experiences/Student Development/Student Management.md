### Our Direction 

The Student Management Committee @ JSS strives to work together with colleagues, stakeholders and partners to create a safe and nurturing environment so that every student can develop and grow holistically. This includes developing self-discipline and good character in our students, and equipping them with the necessary social and emotional skills to behave thoughtfully and be responsible and respectful individuals.  

### Our Approach

We strive towards a balance of order and discipline, with a positive and proactive approach to create an environment conducive for students’ learning and development. This includes going beyond ensuring behavioural compliance in students by focusing on promoting positive student behaviour in support of learning and growth through the teaching of values and skills, and timely reinforcement through corrective guidance to address students’ misbehaviour.
