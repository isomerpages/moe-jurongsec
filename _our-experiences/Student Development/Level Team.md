### Our Directions

Aligned with our school’s vision to develop Champions of Minds, Leaders with Heart, the level team is committed to delivering an educational experience that shapes the lives of our students holistically. This involves creating a supportive and nurturing environment that fosters academic, social and emotional growth. With intentional student development experiences and regular communication with our students, parents and teachers, we continuously strive to create a positive school culture that empowers students to achieve their full potential and become responsible and engaged members of their communities.

### Our Students’ Journey

At the core of our educational approach is the development of a growth mindset and positive habits in our students, with the goal of ensuring Every Child, A Success Story. With this in mind, we have designed a four-to-five-year journey for all students in JSS that centers on 4 unique themes geared towards the achievement of corresponding level outcomes.
