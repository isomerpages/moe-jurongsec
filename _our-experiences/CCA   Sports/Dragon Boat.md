## Dragon Boat
![DB 2024](/images/dragon_boat_2.jpg)


Dragonboat racing is an exhilarating sport that demands exceptional teamwork, physical prowess, and strict discipline. Our students not only enhance their physical abilities but also learn the value of sportsmanship, perseverance, humility, and teamwork. 

Training for this sport involves two essential components: "water" or "boat" training, which focuses on improving rowing techniques and skills, and "land" training, which aims to enhance the students' overall fitness by developing their strength and stamina.
