The thrilling sport of Dragonboat racing calls for teamwork, physical prowess, and severe discipline. Our students learn the importance of excellent sportsmanship, teamwork, perseverance, and humility in addition to how to maintain and enhance their physical condition. Two components make up training: "water" or "boat" training, which focuses on honing rowing methods and skills, and "land" training, which emphasizes students' overall fitness through developing their strength and stamina.
