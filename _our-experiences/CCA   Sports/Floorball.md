## Floorball
![FB 2024](/images/floorball_boys_2.jpg)

The JSS Floorball CCA strives to cultivate respectful and disciplined players who exhibit exemplary conduct as student-athletes and teammates. Despite the challenges of 2021, which has been an unusual year, we remain steadfast in our commitment to help our athletes develop as leaders.

Even though our athletes did not have the opportunity to compete against other schools, we have provided them with opportunities to grow their leadership skills. Our senior players now have a greater role in organizing school-wide activities such as the JSS Learning Fest, while our Captains lead the debriefing sessions following each training session.
