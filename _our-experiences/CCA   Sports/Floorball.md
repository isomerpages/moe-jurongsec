## Floorball

The JSS Floorball CCA seeks to develop players that are respectful and disciplined. All of our athletes behave honorably and responsibly in their roles as student-athletes and teammates. Another unusual year is 2021. Even though our athletes did not have the opportunity to play against other schools, we are still committed to helping them grow as leaders. This year, our senior players have a bigger say in how school-wide activities like the JSS Learning Fest are organized. Additionally, our Captains are now in charge of leading the debriefings following each training session.
