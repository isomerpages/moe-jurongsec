The Sports and Recreational Club seeks to give JSS students the chance to participate in a variety of sports and other leisure pursuits. Cycling, kayaking, and rock climbing were among our previous activities. Our pupils pick up qualities like responsibility, resiliency, cooperation, and sportsmanship through these activities. We conducted a zoom presentation on safe cycling for participating residents of Taman Jurong as part of the National Day Celebration activities organized by Taman Jurong this year.

### SRC March Holidays Cycling & Breakfast to Jurong Central Park


On 15 March 2022, SRC embarked on a short cycling expedition to Jurong Central Park. It was a simple journey where we discovered how extensive the Park Connector Networks are here in Taman Jurong.
