## Sports and Recreational Club
<br>

The Sports and Recreational Club provides JSS students with opportunities to engage in a diverse range of sports and leisure activities. In the past, our activities have included cycling, kayaking, and rock climbing, among others.

Through our activities, our students develop essential qualities such as responsibility, resilience, cooperation, and sportsmanship. As part of the National Day Celebration activities organized by Taman Jurong this year, we conducted a Zoom presentation on safe cycling for participating residents.

### SRC March Holidays Cycling &amp; Breakfast to Jurong Central Park


On 15 March 2022, SRC embarked on a short cycling expedition to Jurong Central Park. It was a simple journey where we discovered how extensive the Park Connector Networks are here in Taman Jurong.
