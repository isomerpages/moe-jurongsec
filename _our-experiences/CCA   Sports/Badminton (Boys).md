**Hard Work Beats Talent**

At JSS, the Badminton (Boys) team stands strong with relentless determination and an unstoppable spirit, always ready to face any challenge head-on. United by our passion for badminton, we train with intensity, encouraging one another to reach new heights. Our teamwork shines in every match as we celebrate each hard-fought point together. Beyond the games, our bond grows stronger, turning teammates into brothers. For us, this journey is about far more than winning — it is about personal growth, friendship, and rising as one.

Beyond training, the CCA conducts monthly bonding sessions to instill values such as teamwork and discipline, strengthening unity within the team. Additionally, members organized pizza parties for graduating seniors as a meaningful gesture of appreciation for their guidance and contributions.

The team firmly believes in the quote, “Hard work beats talent,” and continues to train diligently even during the holidays. With perseverance and dedication, we believe the team will continue to grow and excel to its fullest potential.
