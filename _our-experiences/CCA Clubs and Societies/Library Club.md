## Library Club
![LIB 2024](/images/library_club_2.jpg)

The JSS Library Club is dedicated to nurturing student librarians who are not only critical readers but also passionate about encouraging their peers to embrace reading. To ensure a love for diverse literary genres, our student librarians organize book-related activities that ignite their own enthusiasm for reading. They also work alongside the school librarian to oversee the daily operations of the library, which serves as a central hub for learning and discussion in the school.
