Embark on a journey of discovery and innovation with the Explorers Clubâ€”where curiosity leads to endless possibilities!

Structure and Highlight of CCA:
The Explorers Club at Jurong Secondary School offers students hands-on learning in two exciting units: Technology and Mechatronics. In the Technology unit, members explore drone programming and develop mini buggies using micro:bits, enhancing their coding and engineering skills. The Mechatronics unit engages students in robotics through the LEGO Spike and VEX IQ platforms, promoting creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork. The club actively participates in major national competitions each year, including the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC), National VEX IQ Challenge, and National Robotics Challenge (NRC). Through these experiences, Explorers Club members gain valuable STEM knowledge and build confidence to innovate and excel.
