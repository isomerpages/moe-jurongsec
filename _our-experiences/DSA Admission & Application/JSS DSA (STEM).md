<p><strong>Igniting Minds: A Journey into STEM Education</strong>
</p>
<p>In today's rapidly advancing world, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
and Mathematics) education stands as a cornerstone for innovation and progress.
The JSS DSA STEM programme aims to nurture the youths to thrive in the
digital age, and more importantly, innovate for tomorrowâ€™s world.</p>
<p>Students selected for this DSA STEM programme can look forward to a wide
range of hands-on and minds-on activities. Additionally, they will be involved
in the Explorers CCA and take on the responsibility of STEM Champions to
spread their passion for STEM education. The incorporation of Explorers
into DSA STEM offers a unique platform for interdisciplinary learning,
which closely mirrors the interconnectedness of STEM fields.</p>
<p><strong>Explorer Club (CCA)</strong>
</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Explorers Club (CCA) offers a wide
array of STEM experiences, such as robotics workshops and competitions,
aimed at fostering innovation and teamwork. Students are involved in regular
sessions, where they brainstorm for project ideas, monitor their progress
and troubleshoot their creations. They also learn beyond the school through
field trips to STEM-related industries. Indeed, through learning both within
and beyond the school, our Explorers begin their journey as budding members
of a dynamic community prepared to tackle future STEM challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Design Thinking</strong>
</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Central to our STEM programme is our emphasis
on design thinking. Apart from leveraging the design thinking process to
analyse and ideate solutions for real-world issues, students will also
prototype their ideas through tinkering in our Imaginarium, which is equipped
with 3D and laser printers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Enrichment Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond CCA opportunities, the STEM programme
also offers a range of enrichment opportunities to further inspire and
engage students. This may include guest lectures by industry experts, field
trips to research institutions or technology companies, and participation
in STEM competitions.</p>
