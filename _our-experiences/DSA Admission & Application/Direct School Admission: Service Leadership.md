**_For students who believe in making a positive difference in society_**

Jurong Secondary School (JSS) invites applications from current Primary Six students who are committed to making a positive difference in different social causes in society to participate in the 2022 Direct School Admission Exercise, for admission to our school at Secondary One in 2023.

## Our Service Leadership Programme

**_From Advocacy to Activism_**

Students on our Service Leadership programme are inspired by the view shared by Mother Teresa that “the greatest good is what we do for one another”. Students admitted into the school via DSA-Service Leadership can look forward to an enriching and rewarding experience in making a significant positive impact on the lives of individuals who are less fortunate or disadvantaged in the society.

They will have opportunities to spar with like-minded individuals, supporting different social causes and learn more about how to better understand the needs of different groups of people in the society. They will be **advocates** for various social causes and social needs in community forums and dialogues to be a ‘voice for the voiceless’. They will also be **activists** for these social causes, initiating projects that create a significant impact in bettering the lives of these people. This journey is made even more meaningful as they will be mentored by teachers and individuals with experience in what it takes to truly make a difference in society.

#### Service Leadership Programme

All students on the Service Leadership Programme will undergo a meaningful 4-year Service Leadership programme which focuses on the knowledge, skills and values needed for them to become leaders that rally others in carrying out impactful community projects. With the competencies, skills and values that they acquire in the Service Leadership programme, they will be better equipped to lead their peers to take action to empower the less fortunate, helping the vulnerable in society to become more self-reliant.

Students will get a chance to lead and initiate projects across the different Values-in-Action (VIA) platforms in the school. Some of these platforms include:

<u><strong> Project \[COM\]passion </strong></u><br>
Introduced in 2013, Project \[COM\]passion provides seed-funding for students of JSS to initiate community-based projects to benefit the less fortunate among the residents of Taman Jurong. With funding support from the School Advisory Committee, students will embark on a journey of heightened awareness, advocacy and activism. They will become more aware of and understand the needs of the less fortunate in the community, have the courage and boldness to be advocates who make a difference to the lives of others, and act on the belief that they can make a positive impact in their community.

<u><strong> JSS-TJ Elderly Befrienders Programme </strong></u><br>
The Jurong Secondary School – Taman Jurong Elderly Befrienders Programme was initiated in 2018 as part of the school’s 55th Anniversary celebrations. Our students worked in teams to go to the residences of elderly residents in Taman Jurong to befriend elderly residents who live alone. It is premised on the belief that it is important to instill in our students the core values of graciousness and gratitude, and to enable our elderly to age gracefully and with dignity. Students on the Service Leadership Programme will lead their peers to reflect on their experiences with the elderly residents to design meaningful activities with the residents, bringing a smile to the faces of these elderly residents.  

<u><strong> Citi-YMCA Youth For Causes (YFC) </strong></u>
*   Started by Citi Foundation and the YMCA of Singapore in 2003, the programme is a catalyst to promote social entrepreneurship and community leadership development among Singapore youths.
*   Our students, comprised in teams of four, will have the opportunities to undergo training and volunteer mentorship for executing self-initiated projects to raise public awareness, funds and mobilise volunteers for Social Service Agencies (SSAs) of their choice, as they demonstrate values such as harmony, respect and responsibility as they champion their social causes.
