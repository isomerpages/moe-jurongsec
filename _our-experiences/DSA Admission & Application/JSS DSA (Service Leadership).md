<p><strong>SERVICE LEADERSHIP â€“ STUDENT AGENCY FOR THE COMMUNITY</strong>
</p>
<p>All students in the Service Leadership Programme will learn the knowledge,
skills and values to become empathetic and adaptive leaders, who lead others
to identify societal needs and design impactful community projects to serve
the community. Students will get a chance to initiate, lead and execute
projects across different Values-in-Action (VIA) platforms in the school.
Some of these platforms include:</p>
<p><strong>Project COMpassion</strong>
</p>
<p>Students of JSS initiate community-based projects to benefit the less
fortunate among the residents of Taman Jurong and beyond, with funding
support from the School Advisory Committee. They will embark on a journey
to make a difference to the lives of others, grounded in the belief that
they can make a positive impact in their community.</p>
<p>Past projects include "Zabyss' Compassion," where our students collaborated
with The Saturday Movement to distribute food packs to needy families in
Lengkok Banhru, and "JSS Book Harvest," where our students conducted a
book donation drive with Books Beyond Borders to raise funds for girls'
education in Nepal.</p>
<p><strong>JSS-TJ Elderly Befrienders Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Our DSA students have the opportunities to lead their peers in organising
visits to the elderly residents in Taman Jurong and befriending those who
live alone. Through this programme, our DSA students not only develop essential
leadership skills such as relationship management and organisation skills
as they led their classmate to come up with meaningful activities for the
residents; but also play a key role in instilling in our students the core
values of graciousness and gratitude as they lead their peers in reflecting
on their experience.</p>
<p><strong>Citi-YMCA Youth For Causes (YFC)</strong>
</p>
<p>Every year, our DSA students will take part in the Youth For Causes Project
to deepen their skills in community problem solving and research. Started
by the Citi Foundation and the YMCA of Singapore in 2023, the programme
serves as a catalyst to promote social entrepreneurship and community leadership
development among Singapore youths. Our DSA students will have the opportunity
to learn from those serving the community and receive volunteer mentorship
as they lead self-initiated projects to raise the awareness of and participation
in community projects among their peers.</p>
