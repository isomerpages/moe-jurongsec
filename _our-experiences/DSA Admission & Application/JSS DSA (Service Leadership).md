<p><strong>SERVICE LEADERSHIP â€“ FROM ADVOCACY TO ACTIVISM</strong>
</p>
<p>All students on the Service Leadership Programme will learn the necessary
knowledge, skills and values for becoming empathetic and adaptive leaders
who rally others in carrying out impactful community projects that seek
to empower the less fortunate, helping them to become more self-reliant.
Students will get a chance to initiate, lead and execute projects across
different Values-in-Action (VIA) platforms in the school. Some of these
platforms include:</p>
<p><strong>Project COMpassion</strong>
</p>
<p>Students of JSS initiate community-based projects to benefit the less
fortunate among the residents of Taman Jurong and beyond, with funding
support from the School Advisory Committee. They will embark on a journey
of heightened awareness, advocacy and activism as advocates who make a
difference to the lives of others, and act on the belief that they can
make a positive impact in their community.</p>
<p><strong>JSS-TJ Elderly Befrienders Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Our students work in teams to visit elderly residents in Taman Jurong,
to befriend those who live alone to instill in our students the core values&nbsp;of
graciousness and gratitude. Students will lead their peers to reflect on
their experiences with the elderly residents and design meaningful activities
with the residents.</p>
<p><strong>Citi-YMCA Youth For Causes (YFC)</strong>
</p>
<p>Started by Citi Foundation and the YMCA of Singapore in 2003, the programme
is a catalyst to promote social entrepreneurship and community leadership
development among Singapore youths. Students, in teams of four, will have
the opportunity to undergo training and volunteer mentorship for executing
self-initiated projects to raise public awareness, funds and mobolise volunteers
for Social Service organisations of their choice.</p>
