<p><strong>SERVICE LEADERSHIP â€“ STUDENT AGENCY FOR THE COMMUNITY</strong>
</p>
<p>All students in the Service Leadership Programme will acquire the knowledge,
skills and values to become empathetic leaders, adaptive thinkers, and
concerned citizens, who lead their peers to identify societal needs and
design impactful community projects to serve the community. Students will
be given opportunities to initiate, lead and execute projects through various
Values-in-Action (VIA) platforms in the school. Some of these platforms
include:</p>
<p><strong>Project COMpassion</strong>
</p>
<p>In Project COMpassion, JSS students initiate community-based projects
to benefit the less fortunate residents of Taman Jurong and beyond, with
funding support from the School Advisory Committee. They will embark on
a journey to make a difference to the lives of others, grounded in the
belief that they can positively impact their community.</p>
<p>Past projects include "Zabyss' Compassion," where our students collaborated
with The Saturday Movement to distribute food packs to needy families in
Lengkok Bahru, and "JSS Book Harvest," where our students conducted a book
donation drive with Books Beyond Borders to raise funds for girls' education
in Nepal.</p>
<p><strong>JSS-TJ Elderly Befrienders Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Our DSA students have opportunities to lead their peers in organising
visits to the elderly residents in Taman Jurong and befriending those who
live alone. Through this programme, our DSA students not only develop essential
leadership skills such as relationship management and organisational skills
as they lead their classmates in crafting meaningful activities for the
residents, but also the core values of graciousness and gratitude as they
guide their peers in reflecting on their experience.</p>
<p><strong>Youth For Causes (YFC)</strong>
</p>
<p>Every year, our S3 DSA students take part in the Youth For Causes Project
to deepen their skills in community problem-solving and research. Started
by the Citi Foundation and the YMCA of Singapore in 2003, the programme
serves as a catalyst to promote social entrepreneurship and community leadership
development among Singaporean youths. Our DSA students will have the opportunity
to learn from those serving the community and receive volunteer mentorship
as they lead self-initiated projects to raise the awareness of and participation
in community projects among their peers. In 2024, our students were recognised
with a Merit award for their project advocating for Lions Befrienders.</p>
