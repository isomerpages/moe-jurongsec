<p>JSS believes in developing our students' talents and nurturing them to
be responsible and lifelong learners. Sports and games play a central role
in equipping our students with values that are crucial in their development
as leaders and contributing members of the society in future. In addition
to our core values of Loyalty, Industry, Sincerity and Love, participation
in sports also inculcates important values including discipline, team spirit
and fair play in our students.</p>

less than 100 national titles since 1963. For the achievements made, JSS
is widely known as the 'Sporting Powerhouse in the Westâ€™.</p>
