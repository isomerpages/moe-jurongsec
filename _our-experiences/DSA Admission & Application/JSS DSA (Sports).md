stakeholders to support and chart our students’ sporting journeys.</p>
<p>The JSS DSA Sports Programmes provide well-planned pathways for athletes
to pursue and deepen their sporting passion, so that they can achieve their
long-term sporting aspirations. Every JSS athlete is both challenged and
supported through his or her journey. The school provides structured training
programmes by experienced teachers and coaches, which are grounded upon
Sports Science and Sports Psychology.</p>
<p>We also firmly believe that competitive sports offer a rich and multifaceted
opportunities for students to develop adaptive and critical thinking skills,
especially when athletes have to think on their feet, assess situations
and adapt to changing circumstances. To this end, the JSS Sports CCA programmes
empower our Sports Leaders to co-develop training curriculum and nurture
their teambuilding skills to navigate through the complexities both on
and off court.</p>
