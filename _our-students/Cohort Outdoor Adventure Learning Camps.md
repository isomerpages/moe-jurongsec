<p>Outdoor Education equips students with outdoor competencies to explore
the natural and urban environments safely and responsibly. Beyond the lessons,
students should be given opportunities to apply what they have learnt in
authentic contexts such as Secondary One&nbsp; Cohort Outdoor Adventure
Learning Camp.&nbsp; These contexts engage studentsâ€™ senses to connect
with place, presenting them with opportunities for problem-solving and
decision-making to develop their spirit of adventure and resilience, both
individually and in groups.</p>
