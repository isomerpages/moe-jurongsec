**_For students who are passionate about looking at the world through the lens of a Scientist_**

Jurong Secondary School (JSS) invites applications from current Primary Six students who are passionate about deepening their knowledge and strengthening their passion in science to participate in the 2022 Direct School Admission Exercise, for admission to our school at Secondary One in 2023.

### JSS Science Communication & Research (SCoRE) Programme

Students on our SCoRE programme will embark on a stimulating learning journey where they will channel their curiosity about natural phenomena in the world towards finding meaningful and ethical solutions through scientific inquiry and analysis. By collaborating with others to creatively engage with authentic issues, they will further gain confidence in communicating how science helps them and others make sense of the ever-changing world.

**Research Programme** <br> 
Students admitted into the school via DSA-SCoRE can look forward to participating in different research opportunities. The overseas immersion trip is one of the highlights of the SCoRE programme. It is a platform to equip and strengthen our studentsâ€™ civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills through interactions with foreign students and research institutions on trends in scientific discoveries and research.

**Science Mentorship Projects** <br>
Students who are passionate about science research can look forward to engaging in inquiry projects for areas that they are interested in under the guidance of a teacher or industry-mentor, which could range from topics such as aquaponics and aquatic habitats, and the chemistry of happiness and positivity.
