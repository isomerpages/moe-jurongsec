**Amirthaa** <br>
**Class of 2019**

Our recently graduated alumna Amirthaa from the class of 2019, recently told us about her experience participating in the Honeywell Leadership Challenge Academy at the US Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville Alabama. She was one of only two Singaporeans in the 150 strong group of international participants hailing from 45 different countries. Having earned a spot through a rigorous selection process that looked at her academic, leadership and CCA records, she was thankful for how JSS had prepared her for this opportunity.
