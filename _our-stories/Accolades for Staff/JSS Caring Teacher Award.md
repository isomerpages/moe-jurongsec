The JSS Caring Teacher Award is an annual student-nominated award that celebrates our teachers’ demonstration of care, and their pastoral support for the students’ well-being and holistic development.

Caring Teachers lead, care for, and inspire the students. There are three tiers to this award depending on the number of consecutive wins, the Caring Teacher Award, the Most Caring Teacher Award, and the Most Caring Teacher Award (Sustained)

Congratulations to the recipients of this award!
